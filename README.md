### My projects
* Annotation of song tonalities: [link](https://github.com/TFedir/song-major-minor-classification)
  * An attempt to create a model that classifies songs into minor and major, based on other song data. The main model is based on XGBoost.
  * Technologies: scikit-learn, numpy, pandas
* Analysis of ways to deal with unbalanced datasets: [link](https://github.com/TFedir/id3-unbalanced-datasets)
  * The aim of the project was to analyze different ways of dealing with unbalanced datasets using the ID3 algorithm as an example. 
  * Technologies:  scikit-learn, numpy, pandas, matplotlib
* Platform for handling genetic testing: [link](https://github.com/pzsp2-23z-z10/adnotacja)
  * Group project, enables analysis of DNA mutation variants using existing algorithms, the goal was easy scalability and acceleration of slow calculations
  * Technologies: Javascript, mongodb
* Surrogate model of the objective function for the CMA-ES algorithm: [link](https://github.com/TFedir/cma-es-surrogate-model)
  * Attempt to implement a surrogate model to minimize the number of calls of the target function.
  * Technologies: scikit-learn, matplotlib  
* Subject management system "USUS": [link](https://github.com/TFedir/USUS)
  * Technologies: Java (Spring boot, Thymleaf), LDAP, Docker
* Parking simulation: [link](https://github.com/TFedir/parking-simulation)
  * Technologies: C++
